Pomona-Shuffle
==============

Pomona Shuffle is a web app that allows you to find random classes from the 5C course catalog. Ryan Luo, Hong Suh, Mauricio Molina, and I started it during the 5C Hackathon in April, 2013 and finished it during the summer of 2013. 

The app is made with Flask and a MongoDB database, and all the animations are done through Javascript.
